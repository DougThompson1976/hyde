Hyde 0.1.1 (upgrade from 0.1 recommended and safe for all users)
* Got rid of usocket, I am now using BSD sockets directly.
  Kept cl-ppcre as the only dependency,
  because regexp support is generally useful in user code too.
* Added forgotten u tag.
* Implemented forgotten url-decode (should I be shot?).
* Imported all Apache mime.types.

Hyde 0.1
* First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
