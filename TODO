TO-DO list for Hyde

In no particular order. Anyone who wants to help with development is welcome.

Please also grep the source code for other important to-do's, e.g. using:

$ vim $(grep -rlwi TODO *)


* Binary build for Mac OS X.
* Windows icon.
* More graceful shutdown (especially on Windows).
* HTML to Lisp converter.
* Minimize (compress) CSS of inline style tags.
* Reader macros to support for different kinds of Lisp parentheses, so that
  the user can use multiple parens freely to help legibility just like in
  mathematics: () {} [] <>

  http://symbo1ics.com/blog/?p=275
* Raw strings (where no parsing is done, like PHP nowdocs). See:
  http://www.cliki.net/cl-heredoc
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_document
  http://mihai.bazon.net/blog/hashes-and-raw-strings-in-common-lisp 
  http://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.string.php#language.types.string.syntax.nowdoc
* Feature to check links site-wide for all generated pages and print a report
  of broken links.
* More tutorial videos.
* Provide a feature to upload/update all modified files (vias FTP, SSH, rsync
  and similar, configurable by the user) and another one to generate a list of
  files modified so far (from the last start of the server).
* Feature to add a validate this page button that posts the page HTML code to
  http://validator.w3.org/check (e.g. using JavaScript)
* Consider using the 'online' proclamation for some functions in order to
  optimize. See: http://clhs.lisp.se/Body/d_inline.htm
* A library to access relational databases (e.g. MySQL), but not using SQL,
  that is too complex and verbose for non-programmers, but rather QBE.
  QBE skeleton tables could be represented programmatically using Lisp nested
  lists. The aim is to make it easy to generate one or more static pages from
  database data.

  http://www.cs.sfu.ca/CourseCentral/354/zaiane/material/notes/Chapter5/node2.html
* Well, this is another project. Develop an ECL plugin for Notepad++, alike to
  Geany LispEdit. Provide a simple way for users to load and use the hyde
  package so that they can send s-expr including calls to generate HTML code
  to ECL for pre-testing.
